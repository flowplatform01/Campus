this is my project
Study my app very well and most importantly those 3 other files in my attached_assets folder (for best understanding and remeber this was just the old first stage vertion),
identifying any bugs, errors, or areas for improvement or development if required. Analyze the app's functionality, performance, and user experience. Fix any issues, optimize code, and implement best practices to ensure the app is production-ready . Pay attention to details, and make adjustments as needed to ensure a seamless user experience, testing and making sure all is ok. (my ap uses neon as database and for storage in short when u will study my app u will understand my app and also my neon database... and know what to do best).



Project Context

I have an existing application called Campus, which is a full SaaS platform combining:

A mature, advanced school management system

A fully developed educational social media layer

The app currently exists mostly as a front-end implementation using mock data. Many features are partially implemented or marked as “available soon”. The goal now is to make everything real, production-ready, and fully functional without breaking the existing structure or vision.

1️⃣ Social Media UI & UX Review

Review the social media section, especially the top sub-header navigation bars.

Analyze whether the current organization is optimal.

Reorganize, adjust, or improve these sub-bars only if necessary, keeping UX clean and scalable.

Ensure alignment with an educational social network (not generic social media).

2️⃣ Backend: Full Production Server Development

Fully develop the backend server, which is currently missing or incomplete.

The app is not production-ready because the server logic has not been fully implemented.

Read and use all .env files located in the server folder — all required credentials and configs are already provided.

Ensure clean architecture, scalability, and best practices.

3️⃣ Authentication System (Already Designed, Needs Full Functionality)

The app already has a well-designed authentication flow, but it must now be made fully real and functional, including:

User registration

Login

Email verification

Password reset

Secure session/token handling

School-based access logic

⚠️ Important:

Do not break or redesign the existing auth logic.

Simply connect it to real backend services and make it fully operational.

4️⃣ Email Service (SMTP – Google)

Integrate Google SMTP using credentials already provided in the server .env.

Email system must support:

Email verification

Password reset

School invitations

Announcements and system notifications

Ensure reliability and security.

5️⃣ Database: Neon (PostgreSQL)

Use Neon PostgreSQL as defined in the .env file.

Neon is the primary database for:

Users

Schools

Roles

Posts

Metadata

Media references (URLs)

Database must be production-ready with proper schema design and relations.

6️⃣ File Upload Strategy (Free-Plan Constraint Aware)

Important constraint:
I am currently on free plans.

Backblaze B2:

Used for storing assignment files, documents, and uploads.

Free plan does not support public file viewing.

Neon workaround for public assets:

School logos

Student photos

User profile images

Any media that must be publicly visible

➡️ Strategy:

Store files privately where needed (Backblaze).

Store public-facing image URLs or base64/optimized references in Neon, so logos and profile images can be displayed publicly.

7️⃣ Real-Time Features

Integrate Socket.IO for real-time functionality:

Chat messaging

Live notifications

Real-time social interactions

Must be scalable and production-safe.

8️⃣ Frontend Reconciliation

Revisit the frontend and:

Replace all mock data with real API calls.

Ensure frontend features correctly match backend responses.

Fully implement features previously marked as “coming soon”, especially in:

School management

Academic modules

Social features

9️⃣ Final Goal

Deliver a fully modern and smart advance production-ready SaaS application where:


Frontend and backend are perfectly aligned
 Ensure the entire project is set up for two separate deployments/previews: One for the client (frontend, hosted as a static site or via a framework’s build) and one for the server (backend API, running on a Node.js runtime or similar).

Authentication, email, database, uploads, and real-time features work end-to-end and not forgeting making it smartly equally handle offline first as it is

The app remains true to its original vision and structure

No partial or placeholder functionality remains

Take time to study the app carefully, understand its architecture, and detailly implement everything cleanly and professionally.

🔟 Critical Requirement — Seriousness, Completeness & Future Value

Despite any high-level or vague descriptions above, this application must be treated as a serious, real-world, long-term production system, not a playful or demo app.

Therefore:
Do not rely only on what is explicitly written

Identify and implement implicit, missing, and industry-standard requirements expected in a real school management + educational social platform

Make reasonable architectural decisions where details are not specified

Ensure the system is complete, stable, secure, and future-proof

Additionally:

Develop features fully, not minimally

Test each feature end-to-end, feature-by-feature

Validate real user flows, edge cases, and failure scenarios

Ensure the system delivers real daily value to schools, staff, and students

The final result must be a serious, production-ready platform suitable for long-term use, growth, and real institutions — not a prototype.
