The, the domain that you removed, it should that it was not working, but at least that one was consistent and persistent across the, the, the, the login and registration flow. Even registration, even registration form or page, it was still there up. But now this new one is only, it's only in login, login page, which that is not what I told you to do. And again, when I'm trying to, even though I'm tapping even, I mean in the login page even, when I'm tapping sign in with Google, and then I just now enter a new account, a new account that I've never been registered, uh when I tap it, it doesn't, it doesn't now opens, it doesn't now opens that part that I will select, the, the my app now, because Google has already finished its own. It's now from my app now to now use those collections by Google, then all those info by Google, then it's me now, it's not, it's not showing now my, my, the app is not showing now the whole that I should select. So when I tap that whole now, it will just login me directly. That what I was trying to mean, that was the thing I was trying to mean, because what, when I, when I tap the sign in, normally I, I tap and enter a new account now, then Google will prompt me that I will select. I select and everything will go well. Now it will now fall back to the app whereby the app will just log me directly as a student. Yes, it's only logging me directly as a student, not even, and giving me the opinion to select my role first, just already logging me as a student, which that is a very uh poor managed or poor, that's not smart. So, no, don't spoil the app, but just adjust that thing and properly fix it and test making sure it's properly working. And then that's, and then by flow and everything was probably worked okay. What I told you previously was concerning sign in with Google. It was concerning sign in with Google, not that you should like adjust or fix anything in my app again. It was concerning sign in with Google. And that's sign in with Google that is working. It's only in the login page as I'm telling you. Meanwhile, that other one that was even dummy was across the app. It was even in the registration page. It was still showing up there. But this one that is working, even though you have removed the one that was not working, normally this one that is working. I was also supposed to show, even in registration page, it was supposed to show up there in case the user want to instead tap it, not necessarily writing those info that is required there for those specific Google. So in case, those two things smadly, study the flow, study all what is required, just study the flow, don't spoil it, don't study how the flow works, whether you are relation or your login normally, how you are relation, then now, now adjust the sign-in with Google, how it function, because sign-in with Google, normally Google sign-in normally will be nice. It's only dropping as a student. It will log you in as a student. No good logic or the app will not show you this thing for you to best select. Hope you are understanding what I mean. So this should be properly done smadly without spoiling the app. You are not supposed to do anything. And then when you are done, don't stop, just proceed with the rest to do this. Just proceed with the rest to do this and finish. Yes. So when you are done, don't stop. Properly test it yourself. Properly test it yourself. Properly test it and when you are sure that it's okay, then, then, when you are sure that it's okay, then you can stop, it's okay, and it will work. You just proceed, don't stop, just finish with the rest of the duty, let's finish with this thing once and for all.
