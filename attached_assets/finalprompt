SCHOOL OPERATIONS BLUEPRINT

(Ground truth for your Campus app)

This blueprint assumes:

Academic structures already exist (years, terms, classes, sections, subjects)

Admin screens already expose many things

User-facing screens are underpowered and under-connected

We are aligning, not rebuilding.

1️⃣ CORE PRINCIPLE (THIS FIXES EVERYTHING)

Your app must follow this rule:

Tables live in the database and admin tooling.
Users experience workflows, not tables.

So:

Admin → sees structured tables, grids, controls

Staff / Students / Parents → see forms, actions, states, timelines

This alone explains 70% of the “it feels empty” problem.

2️⃣ SCHOOL DATA SPINE (DO NOT BREAK THIS)

Everything must hang from this spine:

School
 └── Academic Year
      └── Term
           └── Class
                └── Section
                     ├── Subject
                     │     └── Assigned Employee (sub-role)
                     ├── Student Enrollment
                     └── Timetable Slots


If any feature bypasses this → it becomes shallow.

3️⃣ ROLE MODEL (FINAL, NO CONFUSION)
Main Roles


School Admin/School Owner / Director

Employee

Student

Parent

Employee Sub-Roles (not hard-coded, configurable)

Teacher

Principal

Vice Principal

Secretary

Accountant

Librarian

Counselor

IT / Support

Custom roles (school-defined)

Rule:
Features target capabilities, not names.
(“Can record attendance”, not “is teacher”.)

4️⃣ MODULE BLUEPRINTS (WHAT EACH MUST BECOME)
A) Dashboard (Critical Weak Spot)

Dashboard must show real data, not placeholders:

Admin Dashboard:

Total students (current academic year)

Attendance today

Pending admissions

Upcoming exams

Fee collection status

Recent announcements

Employee Dashboard:

Today’s classes

Pending grading

Announcements

Attendance tasks

Student / Parent Dashboard:

Today’s timetable

Assignments due

Attendance summary

Announcements

❌ If dashboard numbers are fake → system feels fake.

B) Schedule (Timetable Engine, not a list)

Admin / Authorized Employee:

Create timetable via guided flow, not table dump:

Select year + term

Select class + section

Define days & time slots

Assign subject + employee + room

Validate conflicts

Publish / lock timetable

Users:

See weekly visual schedule

No editing

Filter by today / week

C) Assignments (Academic Workflow)

Assignment lifecycle:

Draft → Published → Submitted → Reviewed → Closed


Creation:

Employee selects class/section/subject

Adds instructions, deadline, max score

Optional file upload

Student:

Upload submission

View status

Employee:

Review

Score

Comment

Parent:

View progress (read-only)

D) Attendance (Daily Authority System)

Attendance is:

Per academic year

Per class / subject

Time-bound

Flow:

Employee opens today’s class

Marks attendance

Submit → locked

Admin can audit/edit (with log)

Parents & students:

View summaries, not raw tables

E) Announcements (Institutional Communication)

Announcements must support:

Targeting:

Entire school

Role-based

Class/section-based

Priority

Optional expiry

Delivery:

In-app

Email (later)

Parent/student:

Read-only

Timestamped

Ordered by relevance

F) Users & Profiles (Missing Depth)

Profiles must support:

Avatar upload (Neon-stored public URL)

School logo upload

Role & sub-role visibility

Status (active, suspended, alumni)

Default avatar is fine — but change must work end-to-end.

G) Files & Media

Store metadata in Neon

Files via Backblaze (private)

Public-facing images (logos, avatars) → Neon URLs

No broken images, no placeholders

5️⃣ ADMIN AREA (WHERE TABLES BELONG)

Admin section is allowed to be:

Table-heavy

Dense

Powerful

But:

Every admin table must power a user-facing experience

No admin-only features that never surface to users

6️⃣ QUALITY CHECKS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

For every feature, verify:

Can data be created?

Can it be edited?

Is it visible to the correct roles?

Does it survive reload?

Is it scoped to academic year?

Is there a lifecycle/state?

If any answer is “no” → feature is incomplete.
7)
(
(Product + System Architecture)

This is the single source of truth.
No more guessing. No more “maybe later”.

1. Core Concept (Non-Negotiable)

This app is a School Management System (SMS) like Eskooly, NOT:

a teacher app

a student app

an attendance app

Everything hangs on School → People → Academic Structure → Operations.



💡 Key rule:
Teacher is NOT special in code. It’s just an employee with teaching permissions.

3. School Setup Flow (Must Be Sequential in UI)

Admin should NOT see everything at once.

Step 1: School Profile

School name

Logo upload

Motto

Address

Contact info

Default language

Timezone

Academic system type (term/semester)

👉 Without this, dashboard stays “Setup incomplete”.

Step 2: Academic Structure

Academic Years

Academic Terms (linked to year)

Classes / Grades

Sections / Streams

Subjects

UI:

Form-based

Wizard-style

Status indicators (✔ completed / ⚠ missing)

Step 3: People

Employees (with sub-roles)

Students

Parents (linked to students)

4. Feature Domains (No More Mixing)

Each domain has:

DB

API

UI

Permissions

A. Academic Domain

Years

Terms

Classes

Sections

Subjects

Subject ↔ Employee assignment

B. Enrollment Domain

Student admission

Promotion (year → year)

Class transfers

C. Attendance

By class

By subject

By date

Role-restricted (teacher, admin)

D. Assessment & Exams

Test slots

Exam types

Marks entry

Report cards

Visibility control (student/parent)

E. Fees & Finance

Fee structure

Invoices

Payments

Roles: bursar/admin only

F. Communication

Announcements

 Email / In-app notifications

Visibility rules

5. UI RULES (This fixes my biggest pain)
Admin UI

Tables ✔

Bulk actions ✔

Filters ✔

User UI (Student / Parent / Employee)

Cards

Forms

Timelines

Dashboards

NO raw tables unless unavoidable

6. Dashboard Must Show REAL DATA

Examples:

Admin Dashboard

Total students

Total employees

Active academic year

Attendance today %

Fee collection status

Pending setup steps

Teacher Dashboard

Classes assigned

Attendance pending

Exams to mark

Student Dashboard

Attendance %

Results

Announcements

7. Identity & Media Handling

Default avatar always shown

Custom photo overrides avatar

School logo appears globally

Logo fallback if missing

8. Technical Discipline (To Stop Token Waste)

Rules for development:

No placeholder UI without TODO marker

No new table without UI mapping

No UI without permission mapping

No stop-and-ask unless:

data loss risk

schema breaking change

OPTION B — MASTER PROMPT (Give This to the Dev / AI)

You asked for a single powerful prompt.
Here it is — copy exactly as is 👇

🔹 MASTER CONTINUATION PROMPT

You are continuing development of a full School Management System (Eskooly-grade), not a demo or starter app.

Core rules:

Treat Teacher as a sub-role of Employee, not a primary role.

Support Admin, Employee (with multiple sub-roles), Student, Parent.

Assume real schools with principals, bursars, secretaries, etc.

Your task:

Audit existing DB schema, APIs, and UI for completeness — not just existence.

Identify shallow or partially implemented features and fully develop them.

Replace table-only UI with proper form-based and card-based flows for end users.

Ensure dashboards show real aggregated data, not placeholders.

Implement school identity features (logo, profile, branding).

Enforce sequential school setup (profile → academic structure → people).

Execution rules:

Make decisions independently using best practices.

Do NOT stop after each step for confirmation.

Batch schema changes, push DB migrations once.

Implement API, UI, and permissions together.

Avoid token waste by continuing logically until a full domain is complete.

The goal is a production-ready SMS foundation, not incremental demos.
)

 MASTER EXECUTION PROMPT

You are continuing development of an existing School Management System (Campus).
This is NOT a prototype. This is a production-grade, Eskooly-level system.

IMPORTANT
- Your task is to COMPLETE, upgrade, CONNECT, and OPERATIONALIZE what exists.

CORE RULE:
Admin uses tables. Users experience workflows.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Turn all existing modules (dashboard, schedule, assignments, attendance, announcements, profiles)
into fully functional, role-aware, lifecycle-driven systems.


EXECUTION RULES:
- Always follow the School Data Spine (Academic Year → Term → Class → Section → Subject).
- No dummy data.
- No placeholder logic.
- No stopping for confirmation unless a system-breaking issue occurs.
- Push all schema changes.
- Wire backend to frontend immediately.
- Test end-to-end after each module.

MODULE PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Dashboard (real metrics)
2. Schedule (timetable engine)
3. Assignments (full lifecycle)
4. Attendance (daily authoritative record)
5. Announcements (targeted institutional communication)
6. Profiles, media, branding (avatars, logos)
etc

QUALITY BAR:
If a real school cannot operate daily using the feature, it is incomplete.

FINAL EXPECTATION:
- school Admin controls thier school system.
- Employees operate workflows.
- Students and parents receive meaningful, accurate data.
- The system feels authoritative, not decorative.

Proceed continuously until the system is fully operational.
