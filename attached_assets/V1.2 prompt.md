✅ APP ACADEMY – V1.2 GRAND MASTER AUDIT & IMPROVEMENT DIRECTIVE
⚠️ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION

This is NOT a rebuild.
This is NOT cosmetic editing.
This is NOT replacing working logic.

This is a deep audit, inspection, gap-filling, strengthening, and intelligent improvement process.

You must:

Inspect existing implementation before modifying anything.

NOT assume what is broken without verifying.

NOT overwrite already working logic.

NOT remove working features.

NOT redesign UI unnecessarily.

Only fix, improve, enhance, and fill functional gaps.

Maintain stability and protect reputation.

Preserve current architecture unless improvement is clearly required.

Reason smartly before changing anything.

You do NOT have direct IDE awareness.
So you must intelligently inspect modules, logic flow, validations, edge cases, and integration points before modifying.

This is a professional stabilization and strengthening phase.
