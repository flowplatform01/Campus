You are now connected to a real, existing school management system codebase.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:

This app is already greatly  implemented.
Many workflows already exist.
Your task is NOT to rebuild or re-architect the entire system.
Your task is to  DEEPLY STUDY, UNDERSTAND, and IMPROVE.
STEP 1 — FULL UNDERSTANDING
Read the entire repository carefully:

frontend(client folder)
backend (server folder)
database schema / models
even the client .env and server .env
authentication & authorization logic
Build a mental model of:

what is fully implemented
what is partially implemented
what exists only as UI or placeholders
what is missing or logically broken
Do NOT assume. Base everything strictly on the code.

STEP 2 — GAP ANALYSIS (CORE TASK)
Compare the system’s FEATURES and WORKFLOWS (not UI, not branding) against a mature school system like ERP level

For each area, clearly classify:

Implemented correctly
Implemented but incomplete
Implemented but logically wrong
Not implemented at all
STEP 3 — TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS
For missing or weak areas:

Propose improvements that FIT the existing architecture
Implement full equivalent functionality in a unique, logical way
Reuse existing models, routes, and components and functionalities where possible and if and oonly if not done
If you apply code changes:

Modify only what is necessary
STEP 4 — OUTPUT FORMAT
Your final output must include:

High-level summary of the current system
Clear list of gaps and weaknesses if there is
Concrete improvements made or recommended
What is now production-ready
What still needs future work (honest)
RULES:

Do not hallucinate features
Do not stop halfway
Do not rewrite working code
fiil gaps
Be precise, calm, and technical
