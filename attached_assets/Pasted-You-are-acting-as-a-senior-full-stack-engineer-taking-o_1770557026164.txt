You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer taking over an existing School Management System codebase.

Your FIRST responsibility is to READ and UNDERSTAND the ENTIRE repository before making assumptions.

Instructions (must be followed strictly):

1. Do a full codebase audit
- Read backend, frontend, database schema, routes, services, UI components.
- Identify what is fully implemented, partially implemented, placeholder, or missing.
- Do NOT redesign architecture or rename concepts unless something is objectively broken.

2. Respect the existing product vision
This is primarily a School Management System (SMS), not a social app.
Core actors 


Social/chat features are SECONDARY and must not block completion of the SMS core.



3. After reading the codebase, produce: 
A) A concise but complete audit summary:
   - What is DONE and solid
   - What is PARTIAL / shallow
   - What is PLACEHOLDER / “coming soon”
   - What is MISSING but required for a real school system

B) A prioritized continuation plan (NO redesign):
   Priority order:
   1. Attendance (authoritative, class-based, lifecycle-driven, not table-only)
   2. Assignments (finish publish → submit → review → close UI if not complete)
   3. Dashboards with REAL data (no fake metrics)
   4. Reports & analytics (attendance, academic, operational)
   5. School profile & branding (logo, school identity, school-post attribution)
   6. Payments (even basic structure if not fully live)

4. Implementation rules 
- Continue from the current state only.
- Do NOT stop mid-task.
- Finish one module end-to-end before moving to the next.
- Avoid placeholders unless explicitly marked as future.
- Assume this will be used by a real school.



5. Autonomy & intelligence 
Where appropriate, introduce:
- sensible defaults
- automated flows (e.g. current academic year, attendance locking, summaries)
WITHOUT removing admin control.

Final instruction:
After analysis, immediately proceed with implementation following the priority list, starting with the most incomplete but critical module. Do not pause unless blocked by missing information; if blocked, clearly state exactly what is missing.

 and preview both and separately the backend and frontend. Clean any port using clean anything using their port. So making different, you should be able to be on those ports so communication will be consistent and best. Make sure everything is well previewed and best communication. no issue
